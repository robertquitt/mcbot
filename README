Minecraft Query Server/Discord Bot

This is a little bot that I run on my minecraft server, to copy chat messages
to discord, and have a little widget on my website that informs users of the
current status of the server.

Runs via node.js

Install: $ npm install

Configure: $ vim .env
* WEBHOOKURL=https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/...
* LOGFILE=.../logs/latest.log

Run: $ node server.js

Tested with Spigot Minecraft Server 1.15.2 and Node.js v10.10.0 and npm v6.4.1
